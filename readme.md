# WDI Poker Tournament

Let's have a class poker tournament. You instructors will decide the stakes! 

## Starter Code

Starter code with a home page is given. There is also a models folder that contains read/write functions for a JSON data file. 

## Goals

We'll add full RESTful routes so that we can add/view/show/edit/delete all of our teams. If time, we'll test it out!
